> <br/>SafeBite is an AI-powered Android application designed to help individuals with food allergies discover safe and delicious recipes. The app provides personalized recipe recommendations while ensuring all suggested dishes are free from user-specific allergens while still providing them the same amount of nutrition and similar taste than the allergen would have.
